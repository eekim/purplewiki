INSTALLATION

To install PurpleWiki, you must first install the modules, then
install and configures the scripts you will use.

PurpleWiki has several requirements:

  * A web server that can run CGI programs.
  * Perl version 5.6.0 or greater.
  * The following CPAN modules:
    + AppConfig
    + Algorithm::Diff
    + Authen::Captcha
    + CGI
    + CGI::Carp
    + CGI::Session
    + DB_File
    + LWP::UserAgent
    + Template
    + Text::Diff
    + Text::Wrap
    + XML::RSS

To install the modules, first unpack the distribution.  This will
create a PurpleWiki-0.95 directory.  Change directories, and execute
the following commands:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

To install the Wiki:

  1. Copy the wikidb directory included in the distribution wherever
     you want it.  Copy the directory and all its contents.  This
     directory must be writeable by the web server when running CGI
     scripts.  It should not be in the publically accessible htdocs
     directory.

  2. Edit wiki.pl, changing $CONFIG_DIR to the directory you just
     created.  You can also set this value by setting the environment
     variable PW_CONFIG_DIR.  If you're using Apache, you can do this
     by adding the following to your httpd.conf file:

     SetEnv PW_CONFIG_DIR /var/www/wikidb

     where /var/www/wikidb is the full pathname of your wikidb
     directory.

  3. Copy wiki.pl to your cgi-bin directory.

  4. Edit the config file:

    + Change BaseURL to the URL path of the Wiki CGI
      (e.g. http://foo.bar/cgi-bin/wiki.pl).  It must be a fully
      qualified URL.

    + Change SiteName to the name of the Wiki.

  5. If you have Authen::Captcha installed (recommended), you'll need
     to create a captcha subdirectory in wikidb and in your htdocs.
     This directory must be writeable by your Web server.  When you've
     created these directories, edit your config file accordingly.

  6. If you would like to change the look-and-feel of the site, edit
     the templates in wikidb/templates.  All of the Wiki's HTML output
     -- including links to the CSS stylesheet -- is stored in these
     templates.  More information is available in docs/Templates.wiki.

The Wiki should now be installed.  To test, point your web browser to
the PurpleWiki URL.  You should see a page called FrontPage that says,
"Describe the new page here."  Clicking "Edit text of this page" will
allow you to edit this page.  Add some text, and click save.  If
everything works, your installation is a success!

If you plan to take advantage of Search modules beyond the default,
read the documentation found within the modules to be found in the
Search directory of your PurpleWiki installation in site_perl or 
elsewhere in @INC. Those files include additional configuration
requirements.
