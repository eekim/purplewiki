PurpleWiki version 0.1
======================

PurpleWiki is a WikiWikiWeb that adds purple numbers to paragraphs,
headers, lists, and other fine-grained elements on a Wiki page.  These
numbers can be used to create links to these specific elements.  More
information about purple numbers are at:

  http://www.eekim.com/software/purple/

Currently, PurpleWiki consists of a rewritten parser that you drop
into UseModWiki (http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl).  In addition
to supporting purple numbers, the parser supports multiple output
formats using drop-in modules.  With the proper output modules,
PurpleWiki can be used as a document authoring system.

PurpleWiki is available at:

  http://www.blueoxen.org/tools/purplewiki/

To play, try:

  % ./wiki_trans.pl t/test01.txt
  % ./wiki_trans.pl t/test02.txt

  ...

INSTALLATION

To install the modules, type the following:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

To install the Wiki, copy wiki.pl to your cgi-bin directory.  Create a
wikidb directory, and copy config and intermap there.  Copy
purplewiki.css somewhere in your htdocs directory.

Edit $DataDir in wiki.pl to point to your wikidb directory.

Finally, edit the config file.
