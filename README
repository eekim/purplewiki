PurpleWiki version 0.9
======================

PurpleWiki is a WikiWikiWeb that adds purple numbers to paragraphs,

numbers can be used to create links to these specific elements.
Features include:

  * Fine-grained addressability via purple numbers.

  * Transclusions.

  * Blog integration (MovableType and blosxom)

  * Modular architecture for maximum customizability.

INSTALLATION

To install PurpleWiki, you must first install the modules, then
install and configures the scripts you will use.

PurpleWiki has several requirements:

  * A web server that can run CGI programs.

  * Perl version 5.6.0 or greater.

  * The following CPAN modules:

    + AppConfig

    + Algorithm::Diff

    + LWP::UserAgent

    + Text::Diff

To install the modules, first unpack the distribution.  This will
create a PurpleWiki-0.9 directory.  Change directories, and execute
the following commands:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

To install the Wiki:

  1. Create a wikidb directory.  This directory must be writeable by
     the web server when running CGI scripts.  It should not be in the
     publically accessible htdocs directory.

  2. Edit wiki.pl, changing $CONFIG_DIR to the directory you just
     created.

  3. Copy wiki.pl to your cgi-bin directory.

  4. Copy etc/config and etc/intermap into wikidb/.

  5. Edit the config file:

    + Change ScriptName to the URL path of the Wiki CGI
      (e.g. /cgi-bin/wiki.pl).

    + Change CookieName to a unique single word name.  Cookies are
      used for keeping track of users.

    + Change SiteName to the name of the Wiki.

    + Change LogoURL to point to an image that will be displayed on
      each page.  If you don't want to use a logo, comment out this
      item by placing a # at the start of the line.

    + Change StyleSheet to point to the CSS stylesheet for use with
      this Wiki.  You can use etc/purplewiki.css as a starting point.

The Wiki should now be installed.  To test, point your web browser to
the PurpleWiki URL.  You should see a page called FrontPage that says,
"Describe the new page here."  Clicking "Edit text of this page" will
allow you to edit this page.  Add some text, and click save.  If
everything works, your installation is a success!
