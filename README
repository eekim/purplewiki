PurpleWiki version 0.1 PRERELEASE
=================================

PurpleWiki is a WikiWikiWeb that adds purple numbers to paragraphs,
headers, lists, and other fine-grained elements on a Wiki page.  These
numbers can be used to create links to these specific elements.  More
information about purple numbers are at:

  http://www.eekim.com/software/purple/

Currently, PurpleWiki consists of a rewritten parser that you drop
into UseModWiki (http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl).  In addition
to supporting purple numbers, the parser supports multiple output
formats using drop-in modules.

PurpleWiki is currently alpha software.  More information will be
available at:

  http://www.blueoxen.org/tools/purplewiki/

To play, try:

  % ./purplewiki.pl t/test01.txt
  % ./purplewiki.pl t/test02.txt

BUGS

There are plenty, but no showstoppers (that we know of).  Note that
make test is currently broken.
