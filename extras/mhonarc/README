This is a plugin for use with mhonarc <http://mhonarc.org/> that
adds purple numbers to the archived mail. It also extracts links
found in the messages and stores them in a database file.
Original version is available here

  http://www.eekim.com/software/mhonarc/index.html

This version allows the use of a central PurpleNumber sequence
(see PurpleNumber::Sequence) as the source of PurpleNumbers.

To use, add the following to the main.mrc of the archive or archives
being used:

<MIMEFilters>
text/plain;    m2h_purple::filter;    /path/to/mhpurple.pl
</MIMEFilters>

<MIMEArgs>
text/plain;    purple quote
</MIMEArgs>

In addition define the following either through -definevar on the
mhonarc command line, or through <DEFINEVAR></DEFINEVAR> in main.mrc.

LINKBASE=/path/to/link/storage
BASEURL=http://url/pointing/to/archive/directory

One of:

SEQUENCE=/path/to/directory/containing/purple/sequence
REMOTESEQUENCE=http://url/pointing/to/nid/service

REMOTESEQUENCE overrides SEQUENCE if both are defined.
