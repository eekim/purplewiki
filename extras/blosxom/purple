Blosxom Plug-in: purple

=head1 VERSION

0+1i

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Uses the PurpleWiki text formatting rules for blosxom entries.  Will
also integrate with an existing PurpleWiki installation.  For example,
it will link WikiWords in your blosxom entry to your PurpleWiki.  See:

  http://www.eekim.com/blog/

for an example.

=head2 Prerequisites

PurpleWiki.  See:

  http://www.blueoxen.net/tools/purplewiki/

  http://purplewiki.blueoxen.net/

=head2 Configuration variables

C<$configDir> is the location of your Wiki's configuration directory
(usually called wikidb).  There must be a valid PurpleWiki config file
in the directory, even if you don't actually have a local Wiki
installation.

=head2 Adding purple numbers to your entries

You can use the purple utility (different from this plugin) that comes
with PurpleWiki to add purple numbers to your entries.  However, you
have to be a bit careful, because strictly speaking, a blosxom entry
is not a legal PurpleWiki document.  The first line of a blosxom entry
is the title of the entry.  To make sure that title is not
inadvertently processed by the purple utility, make sure there are no
blank lines between the title and the first paragraph.

Suppose you have the entry entry.txt under the category personal.
Suppose that the URL that will point to this entry is:

  http://foo.bar/blog/personal/entry.html

To preprocess entry.txt, do:

  purple --add_ids --url=http://foo.bar/blog/personal/entry.html \
      /path/to/wikidb entry.txt

where /path/to/wikidb is the path to your wikidb directory.  The --url
option enables transclusions.  If you don't need this feature, you can
omit this option.

=head2 Working with the seemore plugin

To use with Todd Larason's seemore plugin, rename seemore so that it
loads before purple.  Preprocess your entry as described above, then
follow the seemore instructions.
