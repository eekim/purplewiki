wikirss uses LWP and web page screen scraping to directly pull
RecentChanges information into RSS 1.0 format output. Only the
names of the wiki pages are included.

rssCreate uses PurpleWiki::Rss to create a full feed directly
from the PurpleWiki database.

Either can be run from cron or as needed.
