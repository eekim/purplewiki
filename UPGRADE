If you are upgrading from version 0.1 please see the 'UPGRADING FROM
V0.1' information, further below. 0.1 users will need to perform the 
tasks listed in that section, followed by the tasks listed in the 
'UPGRADING FROM V0.9' section.

UPGRADING FROM V0.9
===================

PurpleWiki v0.9.1 uses the same format as v0.9 and requires no 
changes to the content or data files. One significant change
is REQUIRED in the config file.

The Wiki search function has been modularized to allow searches of
the wiki titles and content, blogs associated with the wiki (through
the MovableType and Bloxsom plugins), google and whatever else
you can think of: The system is set up to allow individuals to create
their own modules for searching. See the documentation within
PurpleWiki::Search::Engine and PurpleWiki::Search::Interface.

Which search modules are used is controlled by the configuration
file. To get the default 0.1 and 0.9 behavior of searching the
the wiki titles and content from either the search box or clicking on
page title, you MUST add the following line to the config file:

  SearchModule    =    Wiki

(case matters).

The sample config file in the etc file of this distribution includes
other search configuration examples. Each Search module may require
additional configuration items. These are described in the
documentation associated with each module. Each module may also have
additional Perl module requirements. See each module to find out 
what is required.

UPGRADING FROM V0.1
===================

PurpleWiki v0.9 has a new scheme for NIDs.  In PurpleWiki v0.1, NIDs
were locally unique to each page.  In PurpleWiki v0.9, NIDs are unique
across the entire site.  In other words, the NID of a paragraph on one
Wiki page will not be used anywhere else on the site.

This has a few ramifications.  First, the lastnid metadata tag is no
longer required.  This will simplify things for users.  Second,
copying and pasting nodes between pages is easier, because you don't
have to worry about deleting and regenerating NIDs.  Third, it enables
transclusions.

PurpleWiki v0.9 also uses a new syntax for NIDs: braces instead of
brackets.  See the thread starting at:

  http://purplewiki.blueoxen.net/forums/devel/2003-07/msg00004.html

for an explanation.

Because of the new syntax and addressing scheme, users of PurpleWiki
v0.1 will have to convert their site to the new format.  Additionally,
we are using a new config file format.  The config format is
straightforward; you should be able to manually convert your config
file fairly easily.

After you have converted your config file, you can use the
purpleConvert.pl script (located in the extras directory) to convert
your site's NID information:

  purpleConvert.pl /path/to/wikidb http://your.host

For the URL, just provide the hostname and port (if not 80).
purpleConvert.pl will use the path specified by ScriptName in your
config file.
