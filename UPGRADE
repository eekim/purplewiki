UPGRADING FROM V0.1
===================

PurpleWiki v0.9 has a new scheme for NIDs.  In PurpleWiki v0.1, NIDs
were locally unique to each page.  In PurpleWiki v0.9, NIDs are unique
across the entire site.  In other words, the NID of a paragraph on one
Wiki page will not be used anywhere else on the site.

This has a few ramifications.  First, the lastnid metadata tag is no
longer required.  This will simplify things for users.  Second,
copying and pasting nodes between pages is easier, because you don't
have to worry about deleting and regenerating NIDs.  Third, it enables
transclusions.

PurpleWiki v0.9 also uses a new syntax for NIDs: braces instead of
brackets.  See the thread starting at:

  http://purplewiki.blueoxen.net/forums/devel/2003-07/msg00004.html

for an explanation.

Because of the new syntax and addressing scheme, users of PurpleWiki
v0.1 will have to convert their site to the new format.  Additionally,
we are using a new config file format.  The config format is
straightforward; you should be able to manually convert your config
file fairly easily.

After you have converted your config file, you can use the
purpleConvert.pl script (located in the extras directory) to convert
your site's NID information:

  purpleConvert.pl /path/to/wikidb http://your.host

For the URL, just provide the hostname and port (if not 80).
purpleConvert.pl will use the path specified by ScriptName in your
config file.
