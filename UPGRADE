If you are upgrading from version 0.1 please see the 'UPGRADING FROM
V0.1' information, further below. 0.1 users will need to perform all
of the tasks listed in this document. 

UPGRADING FROM V0.9.2
=====================

v0.93 has a completely new user database and session management
system along with a template driven presentation system.
You will need to upgrade old installations to the new format. 
There are a large number of changes in this version that allow a
great deal of new features.

Perform the following required steps:

1. Run (from the distribution directory):

    perl extras/createUsernameIndex.pl /path/to/wikidb

   This will clean up your user database, consolidating duplicate
   usernames and removing user ID locks.  Make sure all of the files
   in this directory is readable and writeable by your web server.
   
2. Create a sessions directory in wikidb. Make sure this directory
   is writeable by your web server.
   
3. Copy the wikidb/templates directory included in the distribution
   into your old wikidb directory.

   a. Adjust wikidb/templates/common/header.tt so that the 
      stylesheet link points to your preferred stylesheet.
      You may wish to use the etc/purplewiki.css file included
      in the distribution as a reference. The default templates
      use many id and class attributes to allow for flexible
      presentation. If you do not include these in your
      own stylesheet, your wiki pages will not look as good
      as they could.

   b. If you display an image with your wikipages, this is now
      controlled by the templates instead of the config file.
      Look in wikidb/templates/common/header.tt for:

      <!-- img tag would go here if you have a logo -->

      Replace that with an HTML <img> tag.

   c. See docs/Templates.wiki in the distribution for more 
      information about the Template system.

4. Edit the config file.

   a. Change ScriptName to include the entire URL.

   b. Add the following variables:

      ScriptDir
      TemplateDriver
      TemplateDir
    
      LoginToEdit
      UseINames
      CreateLinkBefore
      CreateLinkText
      ServiceProviderName
      ServiceProviderKey
      ReturnUrl

      You can use the config file included in the distribution as
      reference. You can comment out the last four variables unless
      you are planning to use i-names.

      If you wish to require users to login to be able to edit,
      leave LoginToEdit set, otherwise comment it out.

   c. Remove the following variables, as they are no longer used 
      (this is not required, but will keep the file more organized):

      CookieName
      LogoUrl
      StyleSheet
      SiteBase
      EmailFrom
      SendMail
      AdminPass
      EditPass
      FooterNote
      EditNote
      UserGotoBar
      AdminDelete
      EmailNotify
      EmbedWiki
      LogoLeft
      UseLookup

   d. Change KeepDays from the original default of 14 days to 30, 90
      or even 365. This is the expiration time for old versions of pages. 
      The old low number proved unhelpful in the battle against
      spam. We recommend 365. By the end of that time, there will be a 
      more robust data storage system for PurpleWiki.

5. If you use PurpleWiki::Apache1Handler or PurpleWiki::Apache2Handler
   to present wiki formatted text files, see the documentation included in
   the modules for changes to their configuration. The configuration
   file is now found by an environment variable.

6. If you use the experimental RemoteSequenceURL,
   PurpleWiki::Apache1NidHandler and PurpleWiki::Apache2NidHandler
   have been collapsed to PurpleWiki::NidHandler. See the documentation
   included in the modules for configuration information. The 
   URL interface remains the same.

UPGRADING FROM V0.9.1
=====================

There is one new directive in the PurpleWiki config file:
LocalSequenceDir.  Make sure you add the following line to your config
file when upgrading from v0.9.1:

  LocalSequenceDir = $DataDir

UPGRADING FROM V0.9
===================

PurpleWiki v0.9.1 uses the same format as v0.9 and requires no 
changes to the content or data files. One significant change
is REQUIRED in the config file.

The Wiki search function has been modularized to allow searches of
the wiki titles and content, blogs associated with the wiki (through
the MovableType and Bloxsom plugins), google and whatever else
you can think of: The system is set up to allow individuals to create
their own modules for searching. See the documentation within
PurpleWiki::Search::Engine and PurpleWiki::Search::Interface.

Which search modules are used is controlled by the configuration
file. To get the default 0.1 and 0.9 behavior of searching the
the wiki titles and content from either the search box or clicking on
page title, you MUST add the following line to the config file:

  SearchModule    =    Wiki

(case matters).

The sample config file in the etc file of this distribution includes
other search configuration examples. Each Search module may require
additional configuration items. These are described in the
documentation associated with each module. Each module may also have
additional Perl module requirements. See each module to find out 
what is required.

UPGRADING FROM V0.1
===================

PurpleWiki v0.9 has a new scheme for NIDs.  In PurpleWiki v0.1, NIDs
were locally unique to each page.  In PurpleWiki v0.9, NIDs are unique
across the entire site.  In other words, the NID of a paragraph on one
Wiki page will not be used anywhere else on the site.

This has a few ramifications.  First, the lastnid metadata tag is no
longer required.  This will simplify things for users.  Second,
copying and pasting nodes between pages is easier, because you don't
have to worry about deleting and regenerating NIDs.  Third, it enables
transclusions.

PurpleWiki v0.9 also uses a new syntax for NIDs: braces instead of
brackets.  See the thread starting at:

  http://purplewiki.blueoxen.net/forums/devel/2003-07/msg00004.html

for an explanation.

Because of the new syntax and addressing scheme, users of PurpleWiki
v0.1 will have to convert their site to the new format.  Additionally,
we are using a new config file format.  The config format is
straightforward; you should be able to manually convert your config
file fairly easily.

After you have converted your config file, you can use the
purpleConvert.pl script (located in the extras directory) to convert
your site's NID information:

  purpleConvert.pl /path/to/wikidb http://your.host

For the URL, just provide the hostname and port (if not 80).
purpleConvert.pl will use the path specified by ScriptName in your
config file.
