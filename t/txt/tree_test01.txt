= Basic Wiki Test =

== Introduction ==

This is a bare-bones, error-free example of a textual Wiki page.  The
question is, will this parse correctly?

  Only time will tell.
  And tell it will.

This is a paragraph.

This is another paragraph.

How about mixed paragraphs and preformatting?
   This should be preformatted.
 But is it?
You should know by now.

What about <strong>HTML</strong> in paragraphs?  You should see the tags.

Does the nowiki tag work?  <nowiki>Well, that depends.  Do you see
'''quotes''' or not?</nowiki>  If so, then be happy!

=== Lists ===

Tests moved to tree_test14.txt.

=== Formatting ===

This is ''italics''.  This is '''bold'''.  This is '''''bold and
italic'''''.

UseModWiki also supports HTML bold and italic tags.  This is <i>italics</i>.  This is <b>bold</b>.  This is <b><i>bold and italic</i></b>.  This is <i><b>italic and bold</b></i>.  This is <tt>monospace</tt>.
=== Links ===
How about a paragraph with some WikiWords?  How about a [[double
bracketed free link]]?  How about a link to [http://www.eekim.com/ my
homepage].  What about the URL itself, like http://www.eekim.com/.
How about not linking a <nowiki>WikiWikiWord</nowiki>. How about a
UseMod:InterWiki link?  Finally, how about separating a
WordFromNumbers""123 using double quotes?

How about some funkier URLs like http://www.burningchrome.com:81/?  Or,
http://www.eekim.com/cgi-bin/dkr?version=2&date=20021225?

= Conclusion =
This concludes this test.  We now return you to your regular
programming.
