= Basic Wiki Test =

== Introduction ==

This is a bare-bones, error-free example of a textual Wiki page.  The
question is, will this parse correctly?

  Only time will tell.
  And tell it will.

This is a paragraph.

This is another paragraph.

nowiki

backslashes for multiple lines

How about mixed paragraphs and preformatting?
   This should be preformatted.
 But is it?
You should know by now.

What about <strong>HTML</strong> in paragraphs?  You should see the tags.

Does the nowiki tag work?  <nowiki>Well, that depends.  Do you see
'''quotes''' or not?</nowiki>  If so, then be happy!

=== Lists ===

* Lists are an excellent test.
* Yessirreebob.
** This is a sublist.
** This is item two of the sublist.
*** This is a subsublist.
** This is item three of the sublist.

# How about numbered lists?
# What about them?
## Will it parse correctly?
### I sure hope so.
## Only one way to find out.

* Mixed list.
* Second item.
## Now do numbered list.
## Again.
* Backed to unordered list.

# Ordered list.
# Number two.
** Now do unordered.
** Again.
# Number three.

;definition lists:Will definition lists parse correctly?
;testing:This is a test.
;;indented definition:This should be indented again.

Okay, some mixed paragraphs and lists.
* This ought to work.
* But I just want to make sure.
Did it work?

=== Formatting ===

This is ''italics''.  This is '''bold'''.  This is '''''bold and
italic'''''.

UseModWiki also supports HTML bold and italic tags.  This is <i>italics</i>.  This is <b>bold</b>.  This is <b><i>bold and italic</i></b>.  This is <i><b>italic and bold</b></i>.  This is <tt>monospace</tt>.

:Indented text.
::Double indented text.
::Another paragraph of double indented text.
:::Triple indented text.

Text after indentation.
=== Links ===
How about a paragraph with some WikiWords?  How about a [[double
bracketed free link]]?  How about a link to [http://www.eekim.com/ my
homepage].  What about the URL itself, like http://www.eekim.com/.
How about not linking a <nowiki>WikiWikiWord</nowiki>. How about a
UseMod:InterWiki link?  Finally, how about separating a
WordFromNumbers""123 using double quotes?

= Conclusion =
This concludes this test.  We now return you to your regular
programming.
