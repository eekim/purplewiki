=head1 NAME

PurpleWiki::Singleton - Enables the Singleton Pattern.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use strict;
    use warnings;

    package PurpleWiki::SomeClass;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use base qw(PurpleWiki::Singleton);

    sub new {
        my $prototype = shift;
        my $class = ref($prototype) || $prototype;
        my $self = bless({ @_ }, $class);

        $class->setInstance($self);
        return $self;
    }

    sub test {
        my $self = shift;
        print $self->{test}, "\n";
    }
    1;

    package main;
    use strict;
    use warnings;

    my $obj = new PurpleWiki::SomeClass(test => "hello world");
    my $obj2 = PurpleWiki::SomeClass->instance();

    $obj->test();    # Prints hello world
    $obj2->test();   # Prints hello world


=head1 DESCRIPTION

PurpleWiki::Singleton is a virtual base class for enabling the Singleton 
pattern in classes that derive from it.  It is safe to use both for stand
alone modules and ones which persist in memory via mod_perl.

=head1 OBJECT STATE

=over

=item _singletonObjectInstance

If used without mod_perl then the derived class will have the global variable
_singletonObjectInstance inserted into its namespace.  Nothing is inserted in a
class's namespace if its used under mod_perl, so don't rely on this being there
and don't be surprised if it is there.

=back

=head1 CLASS METHODS

Class methods can only be called on the class and not on an object instance.
This means you must provide the full package name followd by -> and then the
method name.  For example:  PurpleWiki::Singleton->instance();

=over

=item instance()

Returns the last instance of the class saved by setInstance().  If no
such instance exists then undef is returned.

=item setInstance()

Sets the current instance of the class to be returned by instance().

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over

=item L<Apache::Singleton>

L<PurpleWiki::Singleton> was derived in large part on the equivalent Apache
module.  However, the simplicity of the task and the burden of a module
dependancy ruled out using L<Apache::Singleton>.
