=head1 NAME

PurpleWiki::NidHandler - Remote NID handling for mod_perl (1 or 2)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  in httpd.conf:

   <Location /desired/arbitrary/url/nid>
         SetHandler perl-script
         PerlSetEnv WIKIDB /path/to/wikidb
         PerlResponseHandler  PurpleWiki::NidHandler
         # PerlHandler for Apache 1
   </Location>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a simple, straightforward, but kinda slow
system for providing and resolving NIDs to several PurpleWiki-
library-using sources (such as wikis, PerpLog, or blogs using
plugins.

It is designed to be run as a mod_perl handler in either
mod_perl 1 or 2. It has been extensively tested on mod_perl 2
but not mod_perl 1.

Assuming the Location (see above) is set to /nid, when the handler
receives a GET url of the form:

   /nid/1/http://purplewiki.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?PurpleWiki

it will respond with one NID for that page. Change 1 to some other
number, and get that many NIDs.

For each NID given out, an entry will be recorded pairing that NID
with the provided URL.

When the handler receives a GET URL of the form:

  /nid/ABC

where ABC is an existing NID, the URL at which that NID is located 
is returned.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 handler()

The default method for a mod_perl handler.

=head1 BUGS

There is no security at this time.

No update mechanism is provided (yet).
