=head1 NAME

PurpleWiki::Search::Arts - Search Arts Repositories

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module add searching of Arts repositories to the PurpleWiki
module search system. Arts repositories are made up of flat
text files in PurpleWiki wikitext format.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Arts was originally written to be a lightweight knowledge base
system with an email gateway for submissions. When PurpleWiki
was developed Arts was extended to keeps its files in PurpleWiki
wikitext format so the files could easily use PurpleNumbers. This
modified Arts system is currently unavailable for release. Interested
parties should contact the author of this module.

This module is provided in part as a demonstration of ways to 
search text files with the PurpleWiki Search system.

To use this module additions are required to the PurpleWiki
configuation file: F<config>. The changes are:

  SearchModule = Arts
  ArtsDirectory = /directory/containing/arts.pl/

The trailing slash is required.

Multiple repositories may be searched if they are all listed in the 
same F<arts.pl> Arts configuration file.
