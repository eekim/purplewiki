=head1 NAME

PurpleWiki::Search::Interface - Base class for PurpleWiki search modules

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Provides a base class for PurpleWiki pluggable search modules. All
search modules should use this class and provide a search functionality
by overriding the search() method.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Modular searching is provided to PurpleWiki through the interaction
of subclasses of PurpleWiki::Search::Interface with
L<PurpleWiki::Search::Engine> and L<PurpleWiki::Search::Result>.

To add a new search module a class much be created that:

=over 4

=item
Uses L<PurpleWiki::Search::Interface> as its base class.

=item
Overrides the search() method to search for results in a
particular domain.

=item
Stores those results in a list of L<PurpleWiki::Search::Result>
objects.

=back

The list of L<PurpleWiki::Search::Result> objects is returned from
the search() method. Any configuration, such as locating file
collections, should be done at the start of this method. 

Access to the current L<PurpleWiki::Config> object is available as
it is passed to the Interface subclass by L<PurpleWiki::Search::Engine>
when a new object is created. Here is an example of how it is used:

  my $configFile = $self->config()->ArtsDirectory() . 'arts.pl';

A search() method may do whatever it likes to get search results: 
open files, read databases, query the internet, etc. Time consuming
operations should be avoided as results are generated and presented
serially.

If a preferred ordering in the results is desired, this should be 
done in the module before the list of L<PurpleWiki::Search::Result>
objects is returned. The normal ordering is reverse chronological.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new(config => PurpleWiki::Config)

=item search($query)

Performs the search query for this module and returns the result
as a list of L<PurpleWiki::Search::Results>.

=item config()

Provides access to the L<PurpleWiki::Config> object being used for
configuration information.
