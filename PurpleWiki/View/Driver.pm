=head1 NAME

PurpleWiki::View::Driver - View driver base class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The PurpleWiki::View::Driver is primarily used as a base class, because by
itself it doesn't do anything but traverse a PurpleWiki::Tree.  This example
defines a view driver that extracts image links from a PurpleWiki::Tree.
    
    package PurpleWiki::View::getImages;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use PurpleWiki::View::Driver;

    use vars qw(@ISA);
    @ISA = qw(PurpleWiki::View::Driver);

    sub new {
        my $prototype = shift;
        my $class = ref($prototype) || $prototype;
        my $self = $class->SUPER::new(@_);

        # Object State
        $self->{images} = [];

        bless($self, $class);
        return $self;
    }

    sub view {
        my ($self, $tree) = @_;
        $self->SUPER::view($tree);
        return @{$self->{images}};
    }

    sub imageMain {
        my ($self, $nodeRef) = @_;
        push @{$self->{images}}, $nodeRef->href;
    }

    1;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PurpleWiki::View::Driver is the base class used by all of the view drivers.
Its default behavior is to recurse down a PurpleWiki::Tree depth first from
left most (oldest) child to right most (youngest) child.  Child nodes are
represented as a list within a PurpleWiki::Tree, so left most means the first
child in the list and right most means the last child in the list.

Other than the methods mentioned in the B<METHODS> section, this class also
uses B<AUTOLOAD> to export pre, main, and post handling methods for every node
type.  Three generic handlers are also exported via B<AUTOLOAD> and they are
called simply "Pre()", "Main()", and "Post()" and get called on every node. 

For example, for every node of type "section" the following handlers are
exported via B<AUTOLOAD>:

    sectionPre()
    sectionMain()
    sectionPost()

The pre handler is called before the node, the main is called to process the
node, and the post handler is called after the main handler has finished.  
Since we're in a tree, the main handler may not finish until much recursion
has occurred.

The default action of both the generic and node specific pre and post handlers
is to do a no-op.  The default generic Main handler is also a no-op.  The only
methods exported via B<AUTOLOAD> which are not no-ops are the node specific main
handlers.  Their default action is to call recurse(), which is documented in
the B<METHODS> section below.

The calling order of the handlers is as follows:

    generic Pre handler (defaults to no-op)
    node specific Pre handler (defaults to no-op)

    generic Main handler (defaults to no-op)
    node specific Main handler (defaults to recurse())

    node specific Post handler (defaults to no-op)
    generic Post handler (defaults to no-op)

The only data passed into a handler is a reference to a node object.  So for
example, the resulting method calls when processing a "ul" node would be as
follows:
    
    $self->Pre($nodeRef);
    $self->ulPre($nodeRef);

    $self->Main($nodeRef);
    $self->ulMain($nodeRef);

    $self->ulPost($nodeRef);
    $self->Post($nodeRef);

This calling order is defined in processNode(), so if you overload that method
you could possibly change the calling order.  Also remember that overloading
a node specific main handler will stop the recursion at that node unless you
explicitly call recurse() in your overloaded method.

=head1 OBJECT STATE

=head2 depth

The driver's current depth while recursing through the PurpleWiki::Tree.  The
value of depth should be 0 before and after a call to the view() method.  The
value of depth is changed in processNode() and so is only sure to be correct as
long as processNode() hasn't been overloaded in another class. 

Since our object is a blessed hash reference you retrieve the value of depth
like this: $self->{depth}

=head1 METHODS

The following methods are explicitly defined in F<Driver.pm> and are available
for overloading.  In addition to these all of the methods generated via the
B<AUTOLOAD> function are also availble for overloading.  The functions defined
via B<AUTOLOAD> are talked about in the B<DESCRIPTION> section.

=head2 new(config => $config)

Returns a new PurpleWiki::View::Driver().  If config is not passed in then a
fatal error occurs.  The state variable depth is set to 0 at this point.

=head2 view($wikiTree)

This method is the common entry point for most view drivers.  This method
should be overloaded in derived classes and should return whatever is 
appropriate for the derived class it's in.  

This method returns nothing by default and it's only action is to call
processNode() on the root of the wikiTree.  

Every derived class should call $self->SUPER::view() in their overloaded
version.

=head2 recurse($nodeRef)

If $nodeRef is a StructuralNode then recurse() calls traverse() on the
node's content field and then calls traverse() on the node's children field.

If $nodeRef is an InlineNode, then recurse() simply calls traverse() on the
node's children field.

This method returns nothing by default.  This method should only be overloaded
if you want to make major changes to how a PurpleWiki::Tree is processed.  

This method is the default action for the node specific main handlers defined
via B<AUTOLOAD>.

=head2 traverse($nodeListRef)

Iterates through a list of nodes and calls processNode() on each one.  This
method should only be overloaded if you want to make major changes to how a
PurpleWiki::Tree is processed.  It returns nothing by default.

=head2 processNode($nodeRef)

Calls all of the handlers for a node and updates the value of the object state
variable "depth."  The default behavior is as follows:

=over

=item * 

Increment depth.

=item *

Call generic Pre handler.

=item *

Call node specific Pre handler.

=item *

Call generic Main handler.

=item *

Call node specific Main handler.

=item *

Call node specific Post handler.

=item *

Call generic Post handler.

=item *

Decrement depth.

=back

This method returns nothing by default and should only be overloaded if you
want to make major changes to how a PurpleWiki::Tree is processed.

=head2 noop($nodeRef)

Does nothing and returns nothing.  This is the default behavior of all but the
node specific main handlers.  Sometimes it is useful to overload for debugging
purposes.
