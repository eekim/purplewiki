Revision history for PurpleWiki.

0.95 -- November 29, 2004
	- Pluggable backends.  We've replaced the old default UseMod
	  backend with a PlainText backend.  There's also an experimental
	  Subversion backend, and it's easy to write your own as well.
	  The new default backend fixes some bugs and untoward behavior in
	  old versions, and should be much more stable.
	- Fully localized.  Supports multilingual output and templates.
	- Integrated Authen::Captcha into account creation, which attempts
	  to confirm that the person creating an account is a human, not a
	  spambot.
	- Updates the NID database correctly, so transclusions will still
	  work, even if content is moved to different pages.
	- Extensive modularization.  You can now customize even more of
	  PurpleWiki's behavior.  Also further streamlined the config file
	  so that it is less confusing.
	- Fixed many bugs.

0.94 -- August 11, 2004
	- A bug fix release.  Re-added a feature that allows you to easily
	  recover vandalized/spammed pages.  Included some documentation in
	  docs/FightingSpam.wiki.

0.93 -- August 9, 2004
	- Customizable look-and-feel via templates.  Improved default
	  look-and-feel.  You can also customize the create new pages
	  look-and-feel via the new CreateLinkBefore and CreateLinkText
	  config variables.
	- Fixed major bug with retrieving old versions of a page.
	- Basic access control, including a new configuration
	  (LoginToEdit) that requires login in order to edit a page.
	- MoinMoin triple braces preformatting syntax.
	- Refactored session management using CGI::Session.  Also
	  generates session log.
	- Built-in support for RSS syndication (action=rss).  No longer
	  need the wikirss cron script, which has been removed from the
	  distribution.
	- Refactored user database and classes.  Can now log in using
	  usernames.
	- Support for Identity Commons i-names.
	- Mostly complete MoinMoin parser, along with a
	  MoinMoin-to-PurpleWiki conversion script.
	- Refactored PurpleWiki::Config using singleton pattern.
	- Improved XHTML conformance.
	- New version numbering system to be more CPAN-friendly.
	- Major code cleanup.  Lots of bug fixes.
	- Apache1NidHandler and Apache2NidHandler have been collapsed
	  to NidHandler, which works for both versions of Apache.

	- New and improved OO View drivers!
	- Support for hard rules (using "----" on a line).
	- Modified the parser to support the XHTML model of nested lists.
	  This is the first step towards full XHTML compliance.
	- Added multiline support for list items and indented paragraphs.
	- Improved installation in Makefile.PL.
	- Additional View drivers for better transclusion support.
	- Moved parentheses support for NIDs back to the wikihtml.pm from
